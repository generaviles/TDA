Implementation of Persistent Homology algorithms, mostly by wrapping existing algorithms in python.  The following algorithms are wrapped;

- RIPSER; https://github.com/Ripser
U. Bauer (2016)

- Cubical RIPSER; https://github.com/CubicalRipser
Takeki Sudo and Kazushi Ahara (2017)

- PERSEUS; http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nanda/perseus/index.html
Software - V. Nanda
Paper - "Morse Theory for Filtrations and Efficient Computation of Persistent Homology", V. Nanda and K. Mischaikow (http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nanda/source/DMPers-Final.pdf)


Implementation of an algorithm to compute the Persistent Homology Dimension associated to a barcode diagram based on the paper; "Measuring Shape with Topology" by Robert MacPherson and Benjamin Schweinhart - arXiv:1011.2258 


Implementation of a Bottleneck Distance algorithm written by Miro Kramer (2013), modified/optimized by Kelvin Abrokwa (2016); https://github.com/kelvinabrokwa/bottleneck
