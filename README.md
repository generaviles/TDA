Implementation of Persistent Homology algorithms, mostly by wrapping existing algorithms in python.  The following algorithms are wrapped;
- DIPHA; https://github.com/DIPHA/dipha
- RIPSER; https://github.com/Ripser
- Cubical RIPSER; https://github.com/CubicalRipser
- PERSEUS; http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nanda/perseus/index.html
- PHAT; https://github.com/blazs/phat


Implementation of an algorithm to compute the Persistent Homology Dimension associated to a barcode diagram based on the paper; "Measuring Shape with Topology" by Robert MacPherson and Benjamin Schweinhart - arXiv:1011.2258
